Experiment Using Google AppEngine, Django/Python and D3
==========================================================

A simple experiment running on Google AppEngine, that allows users (with a Google account) to login, create text items (comprising a title and description), and to then see their text items visualised and animated using D3. Whilst chasing an image of the Queen.

Setting Up:
----------------

The code relies upon the Potato Djappengine (https://github.com/potatolondon/djappengine), so you need to set that up first. Let's say you install it in: 

/home/me/djappengine

The next step, is to clone this repository, and place the resulting "textdisplay" folder in the djappengine folder. So you end up with: 

/home/me/djappengine/textdisplay/

Finally, you need to copy the "master.json" file into the "djappengine" folder, i.e. to /home/me/djappengine/master.json.
At this point, you *should* be ready to go.

From the command line:

cd /home/me/djappengine
./serve &

And then, you should be able to see the result of your handiwork at http://localhost:8080/. You will need a username/password to login, which is "amn/p00t!".
